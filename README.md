Comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 focusing on active cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates.

It describes a detailed and thorough analysis of various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it focuses on:

Active Cases: The current number of people who are infected with COVID-19.
Deaths: The total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.
Recoveries: The number of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
Vaccination Rates: The percentage of the population that has been vaccinated against COVID-19.
Developed an impactful Power BI dashboard featuring column, scatter, and bubble charts for tracking key metrics.

It highlights the creation of a Power BI dashboard that is designed to be both informative and visually appealing. The dashboard includes various types of charts to track important COVID-19 metrics:

Column Charts: Used to display data in vertical bars, which can help in comparing different categories such as the number of active cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates over time.
Scatter Charts: Used to show the relationship between two variables. For example, this could be used to analyze the correlation between vaccination rates and active cases.
Bubble Charts: Similar to scatter charts but include a third variable represented by the size of the bubble.  provide a multi-dimensional view of the data, such as showing active cases on one axis, deaths on another, and the size of the bubble representing vaccination rates.
By including these different types of charts, the dashboard provides a comprehensive and visually engaging way to monitor and analyze key metrics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
